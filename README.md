# Shopbot

A slack interface for a Yaas storefront.

Want to chat it up with a slackbot and still spend some hard earned cash? Shopbot is more than happy to rise to the challenge.

## Getting started

`% npm i`

Then make sure you have the following variables declared in an `.enc` file:

```
SLACK_KEY=<your slack bot key>
SHOP_LOGIN=<the exact login url for your store>
TENANT=<your yass tenant name>
```

Then run `npm run start` and you're off!
